# Kendo UI for ASP.NET MVC 6 demo project

## [ASP.NET MVC Beta 7](https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/milestones)

This repository contains the Kendo UI for ASP.NET MVC examples built against MVC 6 beta releases.

Normally we distribute this example project via our bundles, but the fast paced release cycle of ASP.NET 5.0 / MVC 6.0 make this impractical.

Furthermore, publishing this in the open might be useful for anyone that is building sites agains the MVC 6 beta builds.

This repository will remain live until MVC 6 goes official.
