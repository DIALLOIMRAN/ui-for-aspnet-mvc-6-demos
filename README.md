# Kendo UI for ASP.NET MVC 6 demos

Releases
* [Beta 7](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-mvc-6-demos/releases/tag/beta-7)

This repository contains the Kendo UI for ASP.NET MVC examples built against MVC 6 beta releases.

Normally we distribute this example project via our bundles, but the fast-paced release cycle of ASP.NET 5.0 / MVC 6.0 makes this impractical.

Furthermore, publishing this in the open might be useful for anyone that is building sites agains the MVC 6 beta builds.

This repository will remain live until MVC 6 goes official.
