# Kendo UI for ASP.NET MVC 6 demos

### Description
This repository contains the Kendo UI for ASP.NET MVC examples built against MVC 6 beta releases.

Normally we distribute this example project via our bundles, but the fast-paced release cycle of ASP.NET 5.0 / MVC 6.0 makes this impractical.

Furthermore, publishing this in the open might be useful for anyone that is building sites agains the MVC 6 beta builds.

This repository will remain live until MVC 6 goes official.

### Important note for ASP.NET MVC Beta 8
You need to run the application from the command line using `dnx web`

There's a [known bug](https://github.com/aspnet/dnx/issues/3034) in VS 2015 that will not allow you to run it from within the IDE.
